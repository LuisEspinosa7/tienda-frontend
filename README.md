# Hulk Cardex System - Hulk-Store (Inventory) FRONTEND

Hulk Store is a web app for maintaining a product's inventory. It has a simple landing page to show the services and general info.
Moreover, it has a Single Page Application SPA representing the User Interface. It was developed by Luis Espinosa Llanos and for the frontend it was used the following technologies and tools: 

<table style="width:100%">

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Server	
    </td>

It was written using the best practices for instance, a component oriented approach, and more...
